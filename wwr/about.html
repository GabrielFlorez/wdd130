            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The White Water Rafting Company was founded in 1987 by a group of adventurers who wanted to create a
                company that would take people on wild rides down treacherous rapids. Despite skepticism and ridicule,
                the company outfitted their rafts
                with advanced technology and safety gear and recruited skilled guides. Their reputation grew, and they
                became a global brand with operations in dozens of countries. The company remains committed to providing
                exhilarating rafting experiences and pushing the boundaries of adventure tourism.
